for a quick rundown, this means that:

 -You can use, modify, and redistribute this map to your liking

 -BUT you must credit the original map link in any derivative projects

 -And you must credit it in a reasonable manner and not In a way that makes it seem like I endorsed your usage of my map.

	Some Acceptable ways to credit my map:
		
		Stating the Name of the Map and who Created it (Los Perrito City by Uospag)
		A link to the curseforge page (ideal)
	Saying stuff like "City map not mine" is not acceptable >:(

As long as you follow these basic rules, you can use my map for all sorts of things, like:

-Including it in a youtube video and giving proper credits

-Using the whole, or parts of the map in a new map and providing proper credits

-Including my world in a modpack (and providing a curseforge relation or link credit)

-Downloading a TNT mod and destroying my entire city, uploading it to youtube, and then providing proper credits

-Making a 3 hour video essay critiquing my work, putting lo-fi in the background, and providing proper credits


Just don't be a dummy, dont try claiming that YOU made the map or some stupid shenanigans like that and we should be good :)


I have also seen people use the images I've uploaded of Los Perrito in their videos. 
While those images technically have their own copyright. As long as the minecraft map is credited in whatever project you are using those images for.
Then I will consider that proper credits. If you are using the images by yourself outside the connection to my minecraft map... then you can credit either my minecraft map or Uospag for image credits.
